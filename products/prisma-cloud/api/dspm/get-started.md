## Prerequisites

### 1. Generate the API Key

Before you start using DSPM endpoints, you must first generate a DSPM API key. For more details on the procedure, refer to [How to Generate DSPM API Key](./access-api.md). 

To authenticate, include your Prisma Cloud DSPM API key in the API headers using the format: `dig-api-key:'YOUR_KEY'`

### 2. Base URL

The base URL of your Cloud Security API request depends on the region of your Prisma Cloud tenant and is similar to your Prisma Cloud administrative console URL. See [URLs](./api-urls.md) for a list of Prisma Cloud console URLs and corresponding Cloud Security API base URLs.

Note: The Application Security API uses standard HTTP methods, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
