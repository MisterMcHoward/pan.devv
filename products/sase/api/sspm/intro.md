## Introduction to Prisma Access SaaS Security Posture Management APIs

### What is SaaS Security Posture Management?
SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM) APIs provide tools for continuous monitoring, detection of misconfigured SaaS application settings. 

### Why Use SSPM APIs?
Integrate SSPM APIs to:
- Monitor and manage security configurations.
- Ensure compliance with security best practices.

### Key Features
- Misconfiguration detection and prioritization.
- Automated and manual remediation workflows.
- Integration support for multiple SaaS applications.

### How SSPM Works
1. **Discover SaaS Applications**: Onboard and monitor SaaS apps.
2. **Analyze Configurations**: Fetch assessments and detect misconfigurations.
3. **Remediate Issues**: Resolve misconfigurations programmatically.
4. **Monitor Continuously**: Keep apps secure through automated monitoring.

### Prerequisites
- Access to SSPM.
- API token for authentication.

For more information about SSPM, see 
[SaaS Security Posture Management](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/saas-security/saas-security-admin/saas-security-sspm/get-started-with-sspm/whats-sspm)

These APIs use the [common SASE authentication](/sase/docs/getstarted) for service access and authorization.
