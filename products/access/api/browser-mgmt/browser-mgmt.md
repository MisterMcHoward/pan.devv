Welcome to the Prisma Access Browser (PAB) APIs. These APIs are available for all PAB tenants to scale and automate their processes related to the browser.

All of the functionality exposed by these APIs can also be performed using the
[Prisma Access user interface](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-access/prisma-access-cloud-managed-admin.html).

These APIs use the [common SASE authentication](/sase/docs/getstarted) for service access and authorization.
